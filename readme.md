# Overview

For my learning of a web app I had no initial idea of what you typically do with web apps or how they differed from normal JS or other website based code. After I started researching early on what node js, react, and django did I was kinda dissapointed. Despite my disappointment I tried my best at learning.

This was my first ever attempt and exposure to server side computer programming, I'm still not 100% about it all and I'd say this is probably my least favorite experience so far this semester. I got basic exposure but I feel the end product has been the least rewarding experience because even after I spent 10 hours on learning, following demos, and testing my own website I can't seem to get it to funciton properly.

What I ended up going for was a very basic college website where it features different students, the students each have their picture, resume, phone number, and a link to their linkedin profile. The server side programming would come into affect as the students.json, files, and images would all be stored on a server that would then be passed through as the appropriate pages are navigated to. In the end after all my efforts it never got working, for some reason it doesn't want to work, I've tried troubleshooting it with my own understanding as well as with both chat GPT and Gemini but I haven't gotten it anywhere in two hours so this is where I'm leaving it.

# Web Pages

I completely failed even after countless hours of troubleshooting and programming, I didn't even get one page working. The home page is techinically displaying but for some reason its only showing the header. I had planned on having it have a second web page that would dynamically create html for each of the students and their info but that didn't work. 

# Development Environment

For this project we used Node js, express, and visual studio code.

# Useful Websites

For most of this sprint it was spent learning. Here's some of the most helpful websites I used.

# Future Work

1: Get it actually working, figure out why the rest of the elements aren't getting popoulated.
2: Get CSS working so it looks pretty
3: Add a search function so you can search through the entire department and get their info, links, and contact
